					<p class="bio1">I am Michael Yingling. I was born in Newark, DE in March of 1989. I graduated Howard High School of Technology in 2007 and enlisted in the United States Army as an Air Traffic Controller in 2008. After parting ways with the military in March of 2015, I worked as a civilian contractor in a small control tower in a remote region of the Kandahar province in Afghanistan, and then in the control tower in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. However, careers in aviation aren't for everyone. At the end of the day we humans are ingrained with a predisposition to a sense of accomplishment, and like working in a Post Office with a never ending influx of letters and packages, Air Traffic Control just never ends. So in order to satiate my internal longing to build something, I navigated myself with an adjusted heading into another field that required a different kind of creativity.</p>
